# Javascript
### Overview

It is a simple project which I created using ninjas API using HTML,CSS, and Javascript.
* At very first I created html with basic tags.
* Styled the page with Cascading Style Sheets(css).
*  Created ninjas account and I generate api key in ninjas.

* Then use of APIKey I generate jokes using API Directory -> Entertainment(General knowledge APIs - perfect for building fun) in Javascript.
